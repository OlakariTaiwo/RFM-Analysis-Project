# RFM Analysis Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The dashboard provides insights into customer engagement, loyalty, and sales distribution.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Total Customers:** 1,200
- **Total Revenue:** ₦576.8K
- **Average Recency Value:** 606.94 days *(The higher this number, the longer since their last purchase—indicating possible churn.)*
- **Average Frequency Value:** 1.20 *(Low frequency suggests infrequent purchases.)*
- **Average Monetary Value:** ₦179.89 *(Average amount spent per customer.)*

## 📌 Customer Segmentation Breakdown
Customers are classified into **segments** based on their RFM scores:
- **🔵 Loyal Customers** – Frequent buyers with high spending.
- **🟠 At-Risk Customers** – Haven’t purchased in a long time, need re-engagement.
- **🟡 Hibernating Customers** – Very inactive, at risk of churn.
- **🟢 New Customers** – First-time buyers with potential for retention.
- **🔴 Need Attention** – Mid-tier customers who may drop off soon.

### **Customer Type Distribution:**
- **VIP Customers:** 33.3%
- **Returning Customers:** 33.3%
- **New Customers:** 33.3%
